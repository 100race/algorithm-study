## 문제설명

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.<br>
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.<br>
Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically **(사전식순서)** by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"] <br>
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

## 제약사항

1 <= logs.length <= 100 <br>
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100 <br> 
All the tokens of logs[i] are separated by a single space. <br>
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier and at least one word after the identifier. <br>

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        
        #전처리
        #문자로그인지 숫자로그인지 판단
        letters,digits = [],[]
            
        for i in range(len(logs)):
            if logs[i][-1].isalpha():
                letters.append(logs[i])
            else:
                digits.append(logs[i])
        

        # 문자순, 문자가 동일할경우 식별자순
        letters.sort(key=lambda x:(x.split()[1:], x.split()[0]))
        
        return letters + digits
```
